Hi! Thank you for checking out this readme!

This is basically the source project for Button Warrior, a game project I started on the 4th of November and finalized the current build for on the 24th of November.
BUT, because I keep my assets close to heart (potentially for non-jam personal projects, or perhaps a commercial version of this game?), 
I removed these from these folders. If any hosts/mods to the jam require the assets after all, please drop me a message <3

Enjoy!
